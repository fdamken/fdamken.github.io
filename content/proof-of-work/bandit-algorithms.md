My progress on working through the book [Tor Lattimore: Bandit Algorithms](https://tor-lattimore.com/downloads/book/book.pdf).

- Part I: Bandits, Probability and Concentration
    - Chapter 1: Introduction
    - [Chapter 2: Foundations of Probability](/proof-of-work/bandit-algorithms/lattimore_chapter-02.pdf) (spent roughly 13h)

**Note that this page might not be up-to-date with my latest progress, but merely serves as a quick proof that I actually exposed myself to the subject.**
