My progress on self-studying the field of general topology.

- [James R. Munkres: Topology](https://www.google.de/books/edition/Topology/XjoZAQAAIAAJ) (ISBN 978-0131816299)
    - [Chapter 1 (Set Theory and Logic)](/proof-of-work/general-topology/munkres_chapter-01.pdf) (spent roughly 13h)
    - [Chapter 2: Topological Spaces and Continuous Functions](/proof-of-work/general-topology/munkres_chapter-02.pdf) (spent roughly 43h)

**Note that this page might not be up-to-date with my latest progress, but merely serves as a quick proof that I actually exposed myself to the subject.**
