title: "LaTeX Best Practices"
draft: true
---

I use LaTeX a lot.

And every time I work with other people, I notice things people to weirdly when using LaTeX, not pushing it to its full potential or simply doing things that are “dangerous.”
Of course, not dangerous in the sense of physically hurting anybody, but in risking a non-robust document, weird typesetting, or simply an unpleasant document.

Thus, I decided to collect this list of “best practices” so that I can refer to it and, of course, to make these things more well-known.
Note that this is a bit different from my [LaTeX tips & tricks](tips-and-tricks) and a lot more basic, although I will refer to said page from time to time.

Last Updated: {{% param lastmod %}} (if someone knows how to format the `lastmod` parameter in Hugo’s Markdown renderer, please contact me :D)
